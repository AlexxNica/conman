.SH NAME
conmand \- ConMan daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B conmand
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconmand\fR is the daemon responsible for managing consoles defined by its
configuration file as well as listening for connections from clients.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c \fIfile\fR
Specify a configuration file, overriding the default location [@CONMAN_CONF@].
.TP
.B \-h
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.B \-k
Kill the \fBconmand\fR process that is associated with the specified
configuration.
.TP
.B \-L
Display license information.
.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fR
Specify the port on which \fBconmand\fR will listen for clients, overriding
both the default port [@CONMAN_PORT@] and the port specified in the
configuration file.
.TP
.B \-r
Reopen both the daemon's log file and individual console log files.
This is useful for \fBlogrotate\fR configurations.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-V
Display version information.
.TP
.B \-z
Truncate both the daemon's log file and individual console log files
at start-up.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP 12
.B SIGHUP
Close and reopen the console log files.
.TP 12
.B SIGTERM
Terminate the daemon.

.SH SECURITY
The client/server communications are not yet encrypted.

.SH NOTES
Log messages are sent to standard-error until after the configuration file
has been read, at which time future messages are discarded unless either
the \fBlogfile\fR or \fBsyslog\fR keyword has been specified (cf,
\fBconman.conf\fR(5)).
.PP
If the configuration file is modified while the daemon is running,
the '\fB-k\fR' and '\fB-r\fR' options may be unable to identify the daemon
process.  Consequently, the appropriate signal may need to be sent to the
daemon manually.
