ConMan is a serial console management program designed to support a large
number of console devices and simultaneous users.  It supports local serial
devices, remote terminal servers (via the telnet protocol), Unix domain
sockets, and external processes (e.g., using Expect to control connections
over telnet, ssh, or ipmi-sol).  Its features include:

  - logging (and optionally timestamping) console device output to file
  - connecting to consoles in monitor (R/O) or interactive (R/W) mode
  - allowing clients to share or steal console write privileges
  - broadcasting client output to multiple consoles
