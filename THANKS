While ConMan has been originally written by Chris Dunlap <cdunlap@llnl.gov>,
the following people have contributed in its development:

* Natalie Protasevich <nprotasevich@lnxi.com> with the initial IPMI SOL
  implementation using external processes.

* Levi Pearson <lpearson@lnxi.com> with the subsequent IPMI SOL implementation
  using FreeIPMI's libipmiconsole (which I still need to merge into the trunk).

* Brian J. Murrell <brian.murrell@sun.com> with the initial Unix domain socket
  implementation.
